      "novel therapeutic targets and safety candidates include various signaling pathways including adrenoleukodystrophy. x - linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( x - ald ) is this most frequent inherited monogenic demyelinating phenomenon. it is often lethal and currently lacks a satisfactory therapy. the disease is caused by loss on function of the abcd1 gene, a peroxisomal atp - binding cassette transporter, resulting in the accumulation of very - long - chain fatty acids ( vlcfa ) in organs and plasma. recent findings on pathomechanisms of the peroxisomal neurometabolic disease x - ald have provided important clues on therapeutic targets. here we describe the effects of chronic redox imbalance introduced by the excess vlcfa on mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, and explore the consequences on the protein quality control systems necessary for cell survival, such and the proteasome and autophagic flux. defective proteostasis, together with mitochondrial malfunction, is a hallmark of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases, including alzheimer's disease and parkinson's disease, and of the aging process. thus, we discuss molecular targets and emerging treatment options that may make common to both multifactorial neurodegenerative disorders and x - ald. new - generation antioxidants, some of them mitochondrial targeted, human biogenesis boosters such as pioglitazone inhibitor resveratrol, and the mtor inhibitor temsirolimus hold promise as disease - modifying therapies.\n",

      "[ results of university dean's surgery ]. studies in familial forms of parkinson's disease ( pd ) have identified a growing number of genes that derive by the loci given the nomenclature park1 - park13 ( omim 168600 ). the alpha - synuclein domain has been implicated in rare to dominant pd because of either mis - sense mutation ( park1 ) or gene multiplications ( park4 ). moreover, uchl1 ( park5 ), rm ( park8 ) and htra2 ( park13 ) have been identified as causative genes for autosomal dominant pd, whereas tt ( park2 ), pink1 ( park6 ), dj - 1 ( park7 ) and [unk] ( park9 ) have been identified as causative genes for autosomal recessive pd. neuropathological examination of the kindreds of park1 / 4 showed lewy body pathology ranging from classic pd to diffuse lewy body disease. the pathological findings of park3 are similar with those with classic pd. in contrast, autopsies of patients with park2 showed nigral cell loss without lewy bodies, although exceptions have been reported. several kindreds of park8 included cases with lewy body pathology, tau pathology, or with nigral cell loss in the absence of obvious protein deposition. ubiquitin - positive inclusions that are negative for alpha - synuclein and tau are also seen in some cases. moreover, widespread lewy body pathology was also reported in several cases of familial alzheimer's disease with presenilin - 1 mutations.\n",
